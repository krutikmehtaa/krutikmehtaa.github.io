Hey there!

I'm Krutik and I am currently pursuing my Masters in [Information Science (sepcializing in Data Science)](https://cns.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.djsce.ac.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, India. 

Presently, I am seeking Summer 2026 Internship opportunities in Data Science/Data Engineering. Open to relocation.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with [Professor Hüseyin Tanriverdi](https://msisp.ischool.utexas.edu/graduate-degree/faculty/h%C3%BCseyin-tanriverdi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the use of graph neural networks to map competitive landscapes on first-ever comprehensive US hospital services research. Previously, I was working as a Business Analyst for [Integr8 Inc.](https://integr8fuels.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on their product development & research division. I helped optimize and re-model their key legacy pricing framework. Before that, I was a Senior Analyst at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on their Technology Consulting team. 

I spent a summer working as a Data Science Intern at [Feople Org](https://feople.typeform.com/to/CVSpVa), I helped test and implemeent recommender systems, develop churn prediction models and perform exploratory data analysis on unstructured data. Additionally, I was also a Software Engineering Intern at [VIJ Technologies](http://www.vijtech.com/) where I helped design several websites, handle performance optimizations and usability tests.

I have been fortunate to work with brilliant mentors and grateful to them for their advice and support. In my leisure time, I love trekking and visiting unexplored places. I also enjoy playing soccer, cricket, and tennis.
